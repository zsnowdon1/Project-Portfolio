## Adding capabilities to your workspace

Welcome to my project portfolio web application that is currently a work in progress. I currently am working on the news-compiler application that uses the NewsInfoAPI from my repository (https://github.com/zsnowdon1/NewsInfoAPI) to parse news websites from various sources. A user can select the topics they are interested in, and the application will compile a list of articles they may be interested in.

## What has been done
• Created basic UI view based on VS Code dark theme.
• Created sidebar that allows user to select news topics. These are stored in localStorage and will save for each user.
• Created page header that allows user to select between application. Currently doesn't link to anything.
• Added news cards that display the title, subtitle, and image for an article.

## Soon to be implemented
• Update UI to better match VS Code layout.
• Create bottom component that matches VS Code 'OUTPUT' window that will display the articles contents.
